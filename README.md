## Game Rules

- *Objective*: The objective of the game is to navigate through the cave, collect gold, and reach the exit safely.
- *Hazards*: The cave is filled with dangers such as wumpuses and bottomless pits. If the player encounters a wumpus, they will be eaten and lose the game. Falling into a pit also results in instant death.
- *Weapons*: Players can find a dagger in the cave, which can be used to defend against wumpuses. If the player has a dagger and encounters a wumpus, they can choose to fight or flee.
- *Gold*: Scattered throughout the cave are gold coins.
- *Exit*: The exit is located at the starting position in the cave. Once the player has collected enough gold, they can head to the exit to escape and win the game.
